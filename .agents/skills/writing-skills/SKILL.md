# Writing Skills (Excellence)

Dispatcher for skill creation excellence. Use the decision tree below to find the right template and standards.

## ⚡ Quick Decision Tree

### What do you need to do?

1. **Create a NEW skill:**
   - Is it simple (single file, <200 lines)? → [Tier 1 Architecture](references/tier-1-simple/README.md)
   - Is it complex (multi-concept, 200-1000 lines)? → [Tier 2 Architecture](references/tier-2-expanded/README.md)
   - Is it a massive platform (10+ products, AWS, Convex)? → [Tier 3 Architecture](references/tier-3-platform/README.md)

2. **Improve an EXISTING skill:**
   - Fix "it's too long" -> [Modularize (Tier 3)](references/templates/tier-3-platform.md)
   - Fix "AI ignores rules" -> [Anti-Rationalization](references/anti-rationalization/README.md)
   - Fix "users can't find it" -> [CSO (Search Optimization)](references/cso/README.md)

3. **Verify Compliance:**
   - Check metadata/naming -> [Standards](references/standards/README.md)
   - Add tests -> [Testing Guide](references/testing/README.md)
